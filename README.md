# myTravel app

1. open the project as maven project in your IDE
2. you should have Apache Tomcat server installed in your IDE
3. I used `mariadb` database. `MySQL` should work fine. create a schema named `mytravel`
4. give username, password for connecting database in `application.properties` file. `spring.datasource.username`= `your_db_user_name` 
and `spring.datasource.password = your_db_password`
4. hit and run
